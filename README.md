## Overview

The **Environmental Impact Dashboard** is an interactive Tableau project designed to help organizations, sustainability teams, and decision-makers visualize and analyze key environmental metrics across industries and regions. This dashboard offers a comprehensive view into carbon emissions, energy usage, recycling rates, and compliance levels, empowering users to identify areas of improvement and drive sustainable business practices.

## Business Problem

In a world increasingly driven by data, organizations often struggle to effectively monitor and act on environmental data. With operations spanning multiple industries and geographies, it's difficult to get a consolidated, comparative view of:

* Carbon emissions by region
* Energy usage trends over time
* Recycling efficiency by sector
* Compliance distribution across the organization

This fragmented approach limits strategic environmental decision-making and affects compliance with sustainability standards.

---

##  Key Insight Questions Solved

* Which regions contribute the most to carbon emissions?
* How does energy usage vary year over year?
* Are there regions or industries with notably low recycling rates?
* What is the current distribution of compliance levels?
* Is there a correlation between recycling rates and carbon emissions?

---

## Tech Stack

* **Tableau**: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and the creation of interactive visualizations.
* **CSV Data Source**: 50,000+ records including carbon emissions, recycling rate, energy use, and compliance data.

##  Features & Visualizations

* **KPIs**: Total Carbon Emissions, Energy Usage, and Average Recycling Rate.
* **Bar Charts**: Total carbon emissions by region.
* **Line Chart**: Energy usage trends from 2020–2024.
* **Heatmap**: Recycling rates by industry and region.
* **Pie Chart**: Distribution of compliance levels (High, Medium, Low).
* **Scatter Plot**: Correlation between carbon emissions and recycling rates.
* **Filters**: Region, Industry, Product Type, Compliance Level, and Year.

---

## Key Conclusions

* **Average Recycling Rate**: 72.02% indicates moderate environmental efficiency, but there's room for improvement.
* **Carbon Emissions**: Asia and North America top the chart, indicating urgent areas for intervention.
* **Energy Usage**: Sharp rise in 2022 followed by a steep decline — may indicate temporary overuse or reporting anomalies.
* **Compliance Levels**: Even distribution across high, medium, and low compliance levels suggests a need for stronger standardization efforts.

---

##  Suggestions for Improvement

* **Region-Specific Policies**: Target Asia and North America for emissions reduction strategies.
* **Improved Waste Management**: Focus on industries and regions with below-average recycling rates.
* **Compliance Training**: Boost awareness and implementation in areas with lower compliance.
* **Yearly Audits**: Investigate anomalies in energy usage trends for accuracy and preventive actions.
